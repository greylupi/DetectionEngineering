For the last 3 days, generate a time series data of total bytes(SentBytes + ReceivedBytes) 
per source IP with a 1-day interval using the WebProxy logs.


set query_datetimescope_column = "TimeGenerated";
set query_datetimescope_to = datetime(2023-09-18 09:10:00);
set query_now = datetime(2023-09-18 09:10:00);
//actual query
let _start = ago(3d);
let _end = now();
WebProxy
| where TimeGenerated > _start
| where isnotempty(SourceIP)
| where SourceIP != '-'
| where isnotempty( DestinationIP)
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationIP, SentBytes, ReceivedBytes
| make-series TotalBytes = sum(SentBytes + ReceivedBytes) on TimeGenerated from _start to _end step 1d by SourceIP
